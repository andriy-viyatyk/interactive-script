# Overview: How Interactive Script Works

The "Interactive Script" VS Code extension empowers your scripts to become interactive by establishing a seamless communication channel between your running script and the VS Code "Script UI" panel. This document explains the underlying mechanism that enables this rich interaction.


## The Communication Backbone: Stdin/Stdout

At its core, the communication between your executing script and the "Interactive Script" extension relies on standard input (`stdin`) and standard output (`stdout`).

1.  **Script Execution:** When you click the "Run" button in the "Script UI" panel's header, the extension spawns a new process for your active JavaScript/TypeScript or Python file.
2.  **Output Stream:** Your script, using the `interactive-script-js` or `interactive-script-py` client library, writes special command messages to its `stdout`.
3.  **Input Stream:** The extension listens to the script's `stdout`. It reads all incoming messages and intelligently distinguishes between regular log output and specific "command messages" intended for the "Script UI" panel. For any regular text printed to `stdout`, it's displayed as a standard log in the panel.
4.  **Command Recognition:** A command message is identified by a "magic line" (`[>-command-<]`) followed immediately by a JSON string. This JSON represents the specific command and its parameters (e.g., display a dialog, show a progress bar, or log styled text).
5.  **UI Rendering:** Upon receiving a command message, the extension parses the JSON and performs the corresponding action in the "Script UI" panel â€“ whether it's rendering an interactive dialog, updating a progress bar, displaying a grid, or showing styled logs.

## Two-Way Interaction: Commands with and without Responses

Commands executed by your script using the client library generally fall into two categories:

### 1. "Fire-and-Forget" Commands

These commands send instructions to the extension without expecting a direct response back to the script. Examples include:

* `ui.log()`: Simply prints a message to the "Script UI" panel.
* `ui.info()`, `ui.warn()`, `ui.error()`, `ui.success()`: Print styled messages.
* `ui.show.progress()`: Initiates or updates a progress indicator.

For these commands, the client library sends the command message to `stdout`, and the script continues execution immediately.

### 2. "Request-Response" Commands

These commands trigger an interactive element in the "Script UI" panel (like a dialog or an input field) and **pause the script's execution** until the user provides a response. Examples include:

* `ui.dialog.confirm()`: Displays a confirmation dialog and waits for the user to click "Yes" or "No".
* `ui.dialog.textInput()`: Presents a text input field and waits for the user to submit text.
* `ui.dialog.selectRecord()`: Displays a record selection UI and waits for user choice.

**How Request-Response Works:**

1.  When a "request-response" command is executed in your script (e.g., `await ui.dialog.confirm("Question?")`), the client library:
    * Generates a unique `commandId` (a random GUID) for this specific interaction.
    * Creates a Promise (in JavaScript/TypeScript) or a similar asynchronous mechanism (in Python) and associates it with this `commandId`.
    * Sends the command message (including the `commandId`) to the extension via `stdout`.
    * The script then "awaits" this Promise/asynchronous operation.
2.  The extension receives the command, renders the interactive UI element, and waits for user interaction.
3.  Once the user interacts (e.g., clicks a button, submits text), the extension sends a response message back to the script's `stdin`, also containing the original `commandId`.
4.  The client library's internal message handler listens to `stdin`. When it receives a response message, it looks up the associated Promise/asynchronous operation using the `commandId` and resolves it with the user's response.
5.  The `await` call in your script then receives the result, and script execution continues.

This asynchronous `await` pattern is essential for "request-response" commands, as it allows your script to pause gracefully while waiting for user input without blocking the entire VS Code UI.
